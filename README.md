# vgt_scd4x.py

I found that the adafruit library for SCD4x to be a bit too involved and required a completely different i2c library from what I was already using in a project. So I decided to re-write the library to be a bit simpler to use in our implementation.

### Documentation

I'll be writing up the documentation once I get the library functioning.
